						learn more about deposit methods. In this chapter called ”casino for beginners,” we’re giving you some
						great tips on what you should think about when you want to start playing.</div>

							advantage</div>
						<div class="beginner__item--text">You should always know that casino games are all about luck if you
							win or lose. Also, the house (also known as the casino) have an advantage in all games at all
							times. When it comes to math and these kinds of games you’ll never be in favor of the house. No
							strategies or such will help you. If you happen to win big it’s all thanks to Lady Luck.</div>

						<div class="beginner__item--title">Set your budget</div>
						<div class="beginner__item--text">We’ve said it before and we say it again. Never gamble money away
							that you can’t afford. The best way to prevent doing so is to set a budget before you dive into
							this kind of entertainment. You should never go in with the intention that you’re going to win big.
							Set a limit on how much you’re prepared to lose before you start playing.</div>

						<div class="beginner__item--text">As mentioned above, luck is what you need in order to win. At least
							most of the times. You can try to gain little of the houses’ advantage over you by playing smart in
							table games. Slots on the other side are always based on luck, nothing else.</div>

						<div class="beginner__item--text">Let’s say you’re lucky and you’re on a winning streak. All of a
							sudden you have more money than you started out with. Then it’s time to say ”stop”. Cash out and be
							happy about the fact that you’ve managed to win something and didn’t lose your money. If you don’t,
							your hot streak will eventually end and you might go home empty-handed.</div>
